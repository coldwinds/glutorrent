> This is a BEncoded BitTorrent class that was originally developed by a company called GluTorrent, and was hosted at http://glutorrent.com/developer.

> The http://glutorrent.com domain does not seem to be up any longer, but since this seems to be a useful class, I wanted to make sure others had access to it for posterity.

> I'm not the owner or developer of this code, and I have no idea how to get in touch with the appropriate people, so if you know who to contact about this, please let me know. I will not be continuing development of the class. If you want to contribute, let me know and I'll add you as a contributor on the project.
